## Cisco DevNet Learning Labs Sample Code for Coding Skills

These code examples provide Python scripts to perform coding tasks.

The step-by-step tutorials that work with this code are Learning Labs, displayed within the [Cisco DevNet Learning Labs system](https://developer.cisco.com/learning).

Contributions are welcome, and we are glad to review changes through pull requests. See [contributing.md](contributing.md) for details.

The goal of these learning labs is to ensure a 'hands-on' learning approach rather than just theory or instructions.

## Contributing

These samples are for public consumption, so you must ensure that you have the rights to any code that you contribute.

## Getting Involved

* If you'd like to contribute examples for an existing lab, refer to [contributing.md](contributing.md).
* If you're interested in creating a new Cisco DevNet Learning Lab or code example, please contact a DevNet administrator for guidance.
